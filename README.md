# NamasteReact

Two types of Export/Import

 - Default Export/Import

 export default component;
 import Component from "path"

 -Named Export/Import
 
 export const Component
 import {const name} from "path"

 HW - Can we use both at a time

 REACT is fast because it has faster DOM manipulations
 Whenever State variable updates REACT will re-render my component

 ***** ROUTING *****
 1. Server side routing - when a network call is made it is server side routing
 2. Client side routing - single page application , loading new page is already loaded no network call is made
 

 Good Practice :

 1. No js/component file should exceed more then 100 lines
 2.
